# Website Update III

## Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to update your team's progress towards creating a public-facing, unified project report.

## Instructions
<!--hide-->

Please ensure each of the following assignments is posted and up-to-date.  This is the time to re-evaluate each page to ensure that it matches any conclusions you have since come to since creating it the first time.  


Please make sure the following pages are present and consistent with your final project:


* Main Page: Please ensure main page includes all team members, that all links to subpages work, and that there is a short summary of the work found within.
* Research Question (update)
* Biomechanics Background and Initial Specifications (update)
* System Kinematics (update)
* Dynamics: Please integrate the following items together. You may keep them separate writeups or merge them into one longer page/document. (update)
    * Dynamics I: Basic Kinematics and Constraints to make your mechanism work
    * Dynamics Plan: Describe the contribution of each team member
    * Dynamics Prep (Individual Parameter ID): Include individual assignments that contributed to Dynamics II
    * Dynamics II: External forces added including compliance, contact, and motors.
* Design Optimization (new)
* Manufacturing Planning (new)
* Experimental Validation (new)
* Presentation I
* Presentation II
* Presentation III (new)
* Bibliography (update)

**_Note:_** If you prefer to split your bibliography page so that each page has its own, that is fine too.  Just ensure it / each is up-to-date.


Additionally, please include several new pages:

1. Data - Create a page for sharing all raw data collected throughout the project that does not fit within any of the individual pages.  Data should be included as separate files in your repository or a single zip of your project data.
1. Video/Image Gallery - Please include any raw images/videos of prototypes, designs, experimental setups, etc that did not fit within a particular team assignment.  Remember to upload images/videos to your repository or embed via youtube.
1. CAD and other Design files - Put final versions of designs here.  Make sure you upload a zip file of the design itself.  Consider putting a screenshot of the design in here as well.  Include intermediate files (dxfs) if they were modified by hand.
1. Code -  Create a page for sharing all code created throughout the project that does not fit within any of the individual pages.  This may include:
    * Extra python modules used across multiple assignments
    * Microcontroller code used in your final robot (if applicable)
    * Code for processing data

## Submission

Please include:

1. A link to your team's website
1. A link to your team's website repository on Github


* Ensure **all** links work.
* Ensure all code would work if someone downloaded your repository.
* Ensure images are visible.

Please follow the posted submission instructions for website submissions.
