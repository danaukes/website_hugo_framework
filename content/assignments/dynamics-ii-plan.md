# Dynamics II Plan

## Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to decide as a team how you will split up the various Parameter ID tasks individually

## Procedure

1. Identify and discuss the materials you plan to use in fabrication.  Decide who will be obtaining those materials and distributing them.
1. Identify and Discuss the various parameters you plan to model in your simulation, including
    * actuator modeling
    * input signal specification
    * mass and inertia properties
    * link and/or joint stiffness
    * damping
    * friction
     
      Discuss your plans for experimentally obtaining each of those values, and the model you would like to use for describing each phenomenon.
      
1. Identify and Discuss how you plan to prototype your system and assign one person to do that
1. Identify and Discuss how you plan to collect system-level motion or force data, including
    * method (IMU, video, discrete joint sensors, force/torque sensing) 
    * data extraction approach
1. Identify and Discuss your plan for shared simulation tasks
    * which of you will be updating the code
    * adding model fitting routines
    * filtering, interpolating and otherwise massaging input data.
1. Finally, identify and discuss any reporting tasks that may be needed
    * compiling information into a report (may be combined with the simulation if using Jupyter)
1. Split each of these tasks to the individuals on your team, and come up with at least one deliverable for each person for the remainder of the week
1. The remaining tasks will be assigned to the group for next week's assignment.
