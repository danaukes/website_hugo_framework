# Website Update II

## Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to update your team's progress towards creating a public-facing, unified project report.

## Instructions
<!--hide-->

Please ensure each of the following assignments is posted and up-to-date.  This is the time to re-evaluate each page to ensure that it matches any conclusions you have since come to since creating it the first time.  

Please make sure the following pages are present and consistent:

* Research Question
* Biomechanics Background and Initial Specifications
* System Kinematics
* Dynamics: Please integrate the following items together into one page. You may keep them separate writeups or merge them into one longer page/document.
    * Dynamics I
    * Dynamics Plan
    * Dynamics Prep (Individual Parameter ID)
    * Dynamics II
* Presentation I
* Presentation II
* Bibliography

**_Note:_** If you prefer to split your bibliography page so that each page has its own, that is fine too.  Just ensure it / each is up-to-date.

## Submission

Please include:

1. A link to your team's website
1. A link to your team's website repository

Please follow the posted submission instructions for website submissions.
