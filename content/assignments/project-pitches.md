#  Project Pitches

## Overview

The goal of this assignment is to permit those interested in pitching their ideas to attract a group of people interested in joining them.  This pitch will be used to inspire and promote discussion amongst students before teams are formed.

_This is your opportunity to shape your semester and to accomplish a personal research goal through class.  If, after group discussion, you wish to create other pitches, you may upload them independently to the Google Drive Folder listed below._


## Procedure

<!--hide-->

### Prior To Class

1. Read through [this module](../modules/project/developing-a-research-question.html). 
1. Create one slide summarizing an idea that can be studied through a Foldable Robotics team project
    * include points as to how your project satisfies the points discussed in the reading.
    * include any personal motivation ^[this is your opportunity to shape your semester and to accomplish a personal goal through class]


### During Class (~40 minutes)

1. Break into small, 4-person groups in class
1. Spend 2 minutes each presenting just your research question. (~8 minutes total)
1. Spend 5 minutes discussing the merits of each question against the discussion points.
1. Spend 5 minutes expanding on a selected research question and improving it. As a group, expand the one slide to three slides:
    * Slide #1 should introduce your research question.  Include the members of your group.
    * Slide #2 should address how that particular question is interesting and worthy of study
    * Slide #3 should address how that particular question can be answered in a tractable way that fits within the definition of _Foldable Robotics_
    
    _Do not spend time making your presentation pretty.  Teams that form around this idea will do this later._

1. Report back to the main room to present your three slides to the rest of the class (3 minutes each x 7 = 21 minutes).
1. Post your _team's_ slides to this [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/105fpJsZVnAoKFeHpnkITbjrlawys7F2D?usp=sharing)^[Use your ASU logon to drop the file into this folder] so they can be reviewed offline and voted upon.  Name your slides  "zoom_room_name.pptx".

## Submission

No canvas submission.  Post your _team's_ slides to this [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/105fpJsZVnAoKFeHpnkITbjrlawys7F2D?usp=sharing) so they can be reviewed offline and voted upon.  Name your slides  "zoom_room_name.pptx".
