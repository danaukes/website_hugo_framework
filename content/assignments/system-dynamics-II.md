# System Dynamics II

## Assignment Overview

The point of this assignment is to re-consolidate everything you have learned about your system back into your dynamic model.  It should now include:

* at least one "compliant" element
* all unknown parameters determined and included.
    * joint or system-level damping determined
* An actuator model or stored energy source.
* Ground constraints eliminated (if applicable)
* Closed-loop constraints (if applicable)
* valid initial condition

## Assignment Goals

Your dynamics should include:

* Fully parameterized of model with justification for each model you selected                                               
    * All relevant force / torque models included                                                
    * All important rigid bodies added                                                           
* Contact and friction considered (if applicable)                                                            
* Constraints formulated correctly                                                           
* Energy is plotted and decreasing (when actuators are off)                                                           
* Motion looks reasonable for the mass and scale considered                                  
* Animation included                                                                         
* Bibliography for all references used in parameter or modeling assumptions
