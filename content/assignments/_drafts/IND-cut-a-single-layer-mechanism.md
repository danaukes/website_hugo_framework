#  Cut a Single-Layer Mechanism

The purpose of this assignment is to get you comfortable designing single layer mechanisms and cutting them out on a laser cutter.

## Procedure

### Design the Mechanism
1. Go through the solidworks design tutorial to create a laminate mechanism in an assembly. (20 pts)
1. Render or screen-grab the assembly in an assembled, non-flat state. (10 pts)
1. Create a new drawing from the assembly and save the design to dxf.  
1.** Modify the dxf** so that interior hinge lines are dashed, dotted, or low-power score lines. (10 pts)

### Cut the mechanism
1. Go to the innovation hub website and sign up for cutting time (30-60 min recommended, try to share cutting time with other classmates.)
1. Take a picture of the cardboard/paper in the laser cutter prior to cutting (5 pts)
1. Cut the dxf.  Ensure exterior cuts and interior joints are handled differently.
1. Take a picture of the cardboard/paper in the laser cutter after cutting (5 pts)
1. Reinforce your mechanism as needed prior to use.
1. Take a picture of your final mechanism in the same non-flat state as your rendering. (10 pts)
1. Bring to class.

## Discussion

Answer the following questions:

1. What insights did you gain on the process of making a kinematic mechanism? (10 pts)
1. What mistakes did you make, and how did you fix them? (10 pts)
1. What steps of this process could be best automated with scripting? (10 pts)
1. What steps in the tutorial could be expanded on to provide necessary detail? (10 pts)

## Suggestions

1. You may use prior work. Try the 5-bar spherical mechanism as shown during the in-person tutorial in the Innovation hub.
1. Use any material you have ready access to.  Consider the thickness of the paper / cardboard in selecting a hinge-cutting strategy.
1. I suggest reinforcing joints before you move them too much.


## Submission

Please include:

1. CAD files for your parts and assemblies 
1. the modified dxf you used to cut.
1. Report with the following:
    1. Detailed description of the steps you took, in paragraph form
    1. Include answers to the discussion points above
    1. a rendering of the CAD model, assembled, and in a non-flat configuration.
    1. a picture of the paper in the laser cutter before cutting
    1. a picture of the paper in the laser cutter after cutting
    
Please follow the posted submission instructions.
