# Parts Ordering & Motor CAD Design

## Assignment Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to create the CAD files required to attach your motor to a laminate structure

<!--    _or_

Create a [purchase request](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XGABflngDm9pnT4Y2ZsaNEj7gaVFpzJx-ElOVa_qQKc/edit?usp=sharing) for the motors you would like to order.
-->    

## Procedure

1. Create a bill of materials for the parts you will need for your project

    |                          Part | link |   # |   $ | Subtotal |
    |------------------------------:|:-----|----:|----:|---------:|
    |                         Motor |      |     |     |          |
    |                  Motor Driver |      |     |     |          |
    |               Microcontroller |      |     |     |          |
    |       Battery or power supply |      |     |     |          |
    |        Sensor (IMU suggested) |      |     |     |          |
    | Shaft coupler^[if applicable] |      |     |     |          |
    |                           ... | ...  | ... | ... |      ... |

1. If you would like to keep your robot, purchase the parts you will need.  Attach the purchase confirmations.

    _or_
    
    Check out parts from Dr. Aukes during office hours  (depending on availability).  _These will have to be returned at the end of the semester._  I have the following:
    
    * Sensors (IMU, current)
    * Microcontrollers: Adafruit pro trinket & Adafruit metro mini
    * A limited selection of pololu motors
    * Tower Pro Mini SG92R Servo    
    * mini-breadboards and jumper wires
    * misc motor drivers & ICs
    * rivets for connecting layers together.

1. Based on the dimensions of the motor & shaft given by its specifications, Create a CAD model for at least one of the following items:
    * Your selected motor or servo
    * A mount for the motor/servo housing that can be used to attach the motor/servo to a laminate structure or surface.
    * a shaft adapter/coupling that can be used to attach your shaft or motor/servo's output to a second laminate structure or surface.  
 
    _Coordinate with your team to each design something different._
    
1. 3D print one copy of each part.  _Your team may coordinate to print simultaneously_
1. Take a picture of the printed part from enough angles to see what it is.
<!--1. Bring to class.-->

## Discussion

Answer the following questions

1. How does your motor mount / shaft adapter design align motor motion with your system?
1. Which printer did you use?
1. Discuss the limitations of the machine in terms of specific constraints
    1. manufacturable geometries
    1. size limitations
    1. tolerances
1. How did those limitations translate to your printed part?
1. How would different support material help mitigate specific issues?

## Submission

Please include:

1. Report with the following
    1. BOM (10 points)
    1. Order Confirmations  (10 points)
    1. Rendering of the CAD. (10 points)
    1. Pictures of the printed part(s) (10 points)
1. CAD file(s) (10 points)

Please follow the posted submission instructions for the above items

## Suggestions

* Your design must address how you plan to align the center of your motor's rotational axis with a hinge.
* The coupler will be difficult to print with the precision and stiffness required to hold onto the shaft itself.  I suggest buying an off the shelf coupling (or using the horn supplied with the servo). Then, create a 3d printed adapter for _that_ part.
