#  Presentation IV

## Assignment Overview

Please prepare your group presentation based on your most recent project activities

## Procedure

<!--hide-->

1. Review your team's prior feedback.
1. Create a powerpoint with 8 Slides:
    1. Project Introduction
    1. Current Specifications
    1. Design Topic of the Week(4 slides)
    1. Testing Plan
    1. Next Steps
1. Present Slides in ~8 minutes.  Pass around your design iteration.
1. Integrate feedback you receive from this presentation into the next presentation

## Discussion

The current design topics are:

* Integration progress: Discuss your progress integrating sensors and actuators.
* Cantilever Beam Assignment: combine your team's procedure, results and discussion or select the best single assignment as the basis for your presentation.  Include photos of your procedure and figures you used
* FEA (EGR557 Only): discuss your plans and progress in implementing this week's assignment.
* Dynamics of Device(EGR557 only): discuss your team's procedure and answers to the discussion points, including figures and a video of the device in motion.  Explain whether and/or how the cantilever beam and FEA assignments are contributing to your system stiffness as defined in your dynamics

## Submission

Please include:

1. Powerpoint Presentation

Please follow the posted submission instructions

## Suggestions

A successful project report/presentation will do the following:

1. **Address** deficiencies from the previous presentation.
1. **Discuss** your progress using your project's report outline.  What do you need to know and need to address to be successful?
1. **Present** the most recent design iteration.  It should be a physical device, produced as a result of the last presentation.  Bring it, pass it around
1. **Report** observations you have made of the device moving, modeling and analysis results you have calculated, and/or sensor data you have obtained, depending on the most recent class topics and group assignments.  By the end you should have considered the complete design workflow.  The reporting of data should be related to the current class module and follow up from previous modules.
1. **Discuss** how these observations translate into upcoming design changes, with regard to motion & kinematics, dynamics, sensing, control, etc.  Present *new* concepts/renderings/animations, design files, etc.
1. **Answer** any questions.
