# Report Update II

## Assignment Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to collect group work into the report and to update it as you learn more.

## Procedure

1. Update existing sections.  If you have made major structural changes to your design, please update the report as needed.  This report should report on the final device, not the initial concept.
    1. Biomechanics, Bioinspired animal
        a. Physics-based estimates
    1. Bibliography
1. Assemble new sections.  Take all submitted group assignments and insert them into your outline as appropriate.  This includes
    1. Kinematics, connecting it to the prototype you brought
        a. Motion Path, highlighting how the motor moves the end-effector (not how your hand moves the end effector)
        a. Jacobian calculation
         External Forces, connecting it to your team's assumptions/requirements/constraints, considering springs too
        a. Torque, connecting it to your motor's capabilities
        a. Speed, connecting both to your motor capabilities and the estimated speed of your robot
        a. Power, connecting it to motor and battery specs
        a. Energy, connecting it to battery specs
        a. Motor Model, highlighting the ideal working range
    1. Implementation
        1. Selected Motor 
        1. Selected Battery
        1. Selected Microcontroller

### Report on the performance of your integrated device

* Discuss your progress actuating your device, collecting data, and interpreting your results.
* Answer the questions I have specifically asked your team over the last 2 weeks.

**This can go straight in your report, and this should be the focus of your presentation**

---

## Suggestions

A successful project report/presentation will do the following:

1. **Address** deficiencies from the previous presentation.
1. **Discuss** your progress using your project's report outline.  What do you need to know and need to address to be successful?
1. **Present** the most recent design iteration.  It should be a physical device, produced as a result of the last presentation.  Bring it, pass it around
1. **Report** observations you have made of the device moving, modeling and analysis results you have calculated, and/or sensor data you have obtained, depending on the most recent class topics and group assignments.  By the end you should have considered the complete design workflow.  The reporting of data should be related to the current class module and follow up from previous modules.
1. **Discuss** how these observations translate into upcoming design changes, with regard to motion & kinematics, dynamics, sensing, control, etc.  Present *new* concepts/renderings/animations, design files, etc.
1. **Answer** any questions.
