# Report Update I

## Assignment Overview
The purpose of this assignment is for **1)** your team to create the outline for your project report and **2)** to combine and complete specific sections of your report pertaining to the following topics

* Biomechanics
    * Physics-based estimates
    * References

## Procedure

1. Download and install Mendeley or some other reference manager
1. Create a shared bibliography folder with your teammates in Mendeley
1. Add collected references to your report bibliography
1. Create a template following the [IEEE transactions template](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/create-your-ieee-article/)
1. Create a report outline with the sections listed below
1. Assemble new sections.  Take all submitted group assignments and insert them into your outline as appropriate.  This includes:
    1. Biomechanics Research
    1. Initial Specifications
1. Compile or save to .pdf
