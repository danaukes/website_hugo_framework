# Laser Training

## Procedure

1. Read the entire assignment before starting.
1. Go to the [innovation hub website](https://poly.engineering.asu.edu/research/innovationhub/)^[<https://poly.engineering.asu.edu/research/innovationhub/>] and sign up for laser training.
1. Attend the training.
1. Create a dxf to cut out.  Include your name in the artwork somewhere.
1. Take a picture of the paper in the laser cutter prior to cutting.
1. Cut the dxf.  Use vector cuts to separate the material in your dxf.  (Raster cuts are not preferred since we will not be using them in the course)
1. Take a picture of the paper in the laser cutter after cutting.
1. Pull out the piece of paper from the bed by its outer corners.  Take picture of the piece you pulled out, and one of the remaining pieces in the laser bed. 

## Discussion

Answer the following questions.  These questions presume that you used vector cuts rather than raster etches.

1. What remained in the bed of the laser after you cut it?  Which parts of your design were not reproduced _as drawn_ in the dxf?  
1. Which letters of the alphabet in general cannot be reproduced exactly when cut?  Why? 
1. How is this problem fixed in real life?
1. Assume you have access to the outer and possibly inner paths of each character.  What is the defining feature of characters which will fail to be cut properly in the laser?
1. What steps would you have to take when creating your dxf to ensure you can make your letters and other design geometry look more true to form?
1. Continuing from above, how would you write a script to automatically fix geometry which is not cut as intended?  Be detailed.
<!--
1. Where do you see this concept used in real life?
1. Provide a literature reference(preferred), link, patent, or detailed example.
