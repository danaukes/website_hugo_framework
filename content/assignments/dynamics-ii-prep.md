# Dynamics II Prep

## Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to get your team to model the various aspects of your model including

* The full system
* Actuator Parameters
* Energy Storage Devices
* System / Link Stiffness
* Damping and Friction

## Procedure

### Part I

Your team should have decided what each of your tasks are for this week.  Please ensure you document what your contributions are.  For example, you can omplete a task such as:

* [Tracker](https://egr557.github.io/modules/validation/Tracker%20tutorial.html) tutorial for one joint in your system
* [Actuator Fitting](https://egr557.github.io/modules/validation/actuator-fitting.html) tutorial for your system
* [Solidworks FEA](https://egr557.github.io/modules/compliance/laminate-fea.html) tutorial in conjunction with the [Cantilever Beams](https://egr557.github.io/modules/compliance/cantilever-beams.html) process and [Euler-Bernoulli Beams](https://egr557.github.io/modules/compliance/generated/euler-bernoulli-beams/euler-bernoulli-beams.html) code
* a system-level prototype used to evaluate the validity of your concept
* ...another one of your tasks agreed to by your team.

From the plan put together by your team on Wednesday, apply this principle of data collection and model fitting to one of your team's unknowns.

* To find the stiffness and damping of a link or joint
* To find the motor constants (L,R,I) for a candidate motor or actuator
* Collecting materials and prototyping the system
* collecting System Data
* Updating the code

### Part II

* Write up your process / procedure, detailing the methods used, any assumptions made.
* models used and rationale
* Include
    * code used
    * data collected in raw format
    * figures of your results
    * references used in selecting a  model

## Discussion

<!--1. Please explain how you categorized  variables as known or measurable, and which ones you left free for the optimizer to identify.-->
