    [![Step 8](../figures/solidworks-screenshots/pic08.png){width=50%}](../figures/solidworks-screenshots/pic08.png)

1. Take a screenshot of the sketch

1. Using an image editing program, remove the white background (to make it transparent), crop the image, and save the image as a .png.

1. Open jupyter notebook and create a new file in the same folder as your saved image. Change the mode of the first cell to "markdown".  Create an image by pasting and modifying this text into the cell:

    ```
    ![Alt Text](relative/path/to/file.png)
    ```


    [![Step 11](../figures/solidworks-screenshots/pic11.png){width=50%}](../figures/solidworks-screenshots/pic11.png)

1. run the file and save as a pdf.

## Submission

Please follow the "Submission Best Practices" document posted on Canvas.  This assignment should be submitted as a .pdf document.

(Note: linked images such as the one you created in this exercise will need to be included in a supporting zip file in the future if submitting .ipynb files.  Thus it is good practice to save image files in the same folder as the jupyter notebook and zip the whole folder.)
