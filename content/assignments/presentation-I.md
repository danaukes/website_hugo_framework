#  Presentation I

## Assignment Overview

Please prepare your group presentation based on your most recent project activities

## Procedure

<!--hide-->

1. Create a powerpoint with 5 Slides:
    1. Project Introduction
        * Team members
        * Your team's refined research question
    1. Biomechanics-driven inspiration
        * Prior work on this animal
        * Prior work related to similar robots
        * Biomechanics-derived specifications
    1. Proposed mechanism
        * Figure of Layout
        * Picture of Prototype
    1. Kinematics
        * Solution approach
        * Estimate of Force/Torque required from actuator(s)
    1. Future Plans
        * How does what you learned translate into future action by your team?

1. Practice your presentation.  Use the "record narration" feature to make it possible to save a narrated .mp4 of your presentation.
1. You will then present these slides in class (5 minute presentation max).
1. Finally, after presenting, you will receive feedback from your classmates.  Collect this feedback and use it to fine tune your project and presentation.
  
## Submission

Please include:

1. Presentation file
1. Link to your presentation's youtube video.

Please also embed your presentation in your team's website.  This will be check during the next website update assignment.  Please follow all posted submission instructions.

### Embedding Video in Websites

If embedding videos from youtube in your website, use the share --> embed feature available on youtube to create html that you can paste directly into your makrdown document.

To embed mp4 video straight in your website, you can alternatively use the following code snippet:

```html
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="pathtoyourvideo.mp4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

### Presentation Focus

A successful project report/presentation will do the following:

1. **Address** deficiencies from the previous presentation. (not applicable in the first presentation)
1. **Discuss** your progress using your project's research question as the lens.  What do you need to know and need to address to be successful in answering this question?
1. **Present** the most recent design iteration.  It should be a physical device, produced as a result of the last presentation.  Bring it, show it, and -- in a normal year -- pass it around!
1. **Report** observations you have made of the device moving, modeling and analysis results you have calculated, and/or sensor data you have obtained, depending on the most recent class topics and group assignments.  By the end you should have considered the complete design workflow.  The reporting of data should be related to the current class module and follow up from previous modules.
1. **Discuss** how these observations translate into upcoming design changes, with regard to motion & kinematics, dynamics, sensing, control, etc.  Present *new* concepts/renderings/animations, design files, etc.
1. **Answer** any questions.
