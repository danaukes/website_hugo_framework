# Using Jupyter Notebook

## About Jupyter

Jupyter notebook is a useful browser-based IPython editor that provides inline documentation via markdown and inline plotting functionality for a one-stop-shop coding and documentation experience.  Jupyter is useful for creating living documents for class reports, assignments, or other documents where the results may need to be updated and re-run from time to time, yet still be output in a more professional format than the output of a code execution window.

## Using Jupyter

1. **Open up a command prompt** or terminal and type ```jupyter notebook```.  You can alternately find and run "jupyter notebook" from the windows start menu.  A browser with the jupyter folder interface should open.   Navigate to the file you want to run and select it.  It will open in a new tab and you can use the menu to learn how to run the entire file or one cell at a time.  Errors and values will be seen for each cell.
1. **Navigate to a working directory.**
1. **Start a new Python 3 document.**
1. **Enter code in the cells.**  
    * Cells can be code, markdown or raw.  code cells are used for executing code, markdown is used for documentation, and raw mode is for plaintext.
    * **There is a code mode and a cell mode.** code entry mode is for entering code or text into the cell, and cell mode is used for running the cell, cutting/pasting, and other operations that affect the layout of one or more cells
        * In code entry mode, hit escape when entering text to enter cell mode.  Click on text to enter code mode.
1. **Run the block.** In cell mode, use shift+enter to run a block and advance to the next.  Use ctrl+enter to execute the cell in place.
1. To learn more about jupyter commands, there is a list of them available at help -> keyboard shortcuts.
