## Tips and Tricks


To add a known force, attach a known mass to a string, let it deflect and settle, then cut the string.

To displace a known distance, pull the device in a known direction with a string, measuring the displacement.  Let it settle, then cut the string.

If measuring voltage and current, a power supply's current reading may not be sufficiently fast enough to capture transient responses

If measuring anything that has a  digital readout (but no serial output), make sure the readout is visible by the camera.  You can then convert the voltage reading manually using the video time as a reference.
