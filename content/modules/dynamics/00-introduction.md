## Introduction

Dynamics in undergraduate education can be taught in a variety of ways.  Typically, dynamics courses which present material which fully supports 3D vector dynamics are left to graduate-level courses.  This can be due to many reasons, but one reason is that the load on students is very high in order to produce simple, hand-written, vector derivatives and second derivatives.  It could be argued that the practice of learning how to compute long, vector-based expressions is essential for cementing the learning process.  Without computational support, however, it can be prohibitively cumbersome to introduce advanced concepts like constraint-equations.  In addition, the advising load is also quite high, as 

This paper describes a Python-based package for computing and producing the symbolic equations commonly needed in an advanced dynamics class.  The tool is based around symbolic vector operations, which permit vector operations across multiple frames.  Vector derivative support makes it possible to
