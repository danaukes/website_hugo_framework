# Legged Robots Background

Legged locomotion has been a focus of robotics research for many decades [@Raibert1984; @Waldron1986].  Legged systems are touted for their ability, unlike traditional wheeled systems, to navigate bumpy terrain and step over obstacles {{< cite "Playter2006" >}} and to move in human environments in a more human way {{< cite "Nelson2012" >}}. Legged systems, however, are often quite expensive, however, limiting access to and research on these systems.

Examples of fully-actuated humanoid robots which use zero-moment-point inspired methods {{< cite "VUKOBRATOVIC2004" >}} to achieve stable gaits include Asimo {{< cite "Hirose2007" >}}, HRP {{< cite "Kaneko2011" >}}, HUBO {{< cite "Park2007" >}}, and Robosimian{{< cite "Hebert2015" >}}. Another class of robots utilize system dynamics to permit gaits and controllers which may be considered underactuated at various parts of their gait. Recent examples include Atlas{{< cite "Nelson2019" >}}, Mabel{{< cite "Grizzle2009" >}}, Atrias {{< cite "Hubicki2016" >}}, Cassie {{< cite "Gong2018b" >}}, themselves building off pioneering work in hopping monopods [@Raibert1984; @Raibert1990], powered dynamic walkers[@Pratt1998a; @Collins2005], and passive dynamic walkers {{< cite "McGeer1990a" >}}. Smaller dynamic robots have also demonstrated high performance including the Penn Jerboa {{< cite "De2015" >}}, Minitaur {{< cite "Kenneally2016a" >}}, despite the increased processing speeds required to control and stabilize low-inertia systems{{< cite "Trimmer1989" >}}. Indeed, for small robots, stabilization becomes an important design aspect; solutions include damping via aerodynamic fins or wings [@Fuller2017; @Haldane2013], tuned joint compliance and/or damping in legs, ankles, and feet[@Hoover2010a; @Cham2002; @Spenko2008a], or solving the dual-regime control problems that occur when driving systems past natural leg frequencies [@Goldberg2017; @Haldane2015]. 

Other pioneering designs include quadrupeds such as the series of robots developed by Boston Dynamics [@raibert_bigdog_2008; @Murphy2011], the HyQ[@Semini2011; @Barasuol2018] and MIT Cheetah robots [@Park2017; @Hyun2014; @Hyun2016; @Bosworth2016a], and Anymal {{< cite "Hutter2016" >}}. Many of these robots were developed in part through the DARPA Robotics Challenge [@Park2007; @Hebert2015; @Kaneko2011; @Nelson2019] or through partnerships with industry {{< cite "Barasuol2018" >}}, representing multi-million dollar investments towards their design, fabrication, and control. A number of robots are built with cost in mind [@Shuch2019; @Kau2019; @Wang2019; @Jansen2017; @Lapeyre2014; @Luck2017; @Bosworth2016a; @Lapeyre2013; @agheli_design_2014], though for legged robots even \$10,000 can be considered affordable {{< cite "Bosworth2016a" >}}. A variety of topics have been studied in the context of legged locomotion, including the role stiffness plays in actuators {{< cite "Robinson1999" >}}, feet {{< cite "Altendorfer2001" >}}, spines {{< cite "Khoramshahi2013" >}}, and legs {{< cite "Sprowitz2013" >}}.  

## Modeling and Optimization

Traditional methods for controlling robotic systems often utilize simplified dynamic models such as the spring-loaded inverted pendulum(SLIP) model and its derivatives [@Faraji2014; @Kaneko2011; @Pratt2012; @Rezazadeh2015; @Apgar2018b] in order to deal with complex walking systems. These simple representations go a long way towards helping roboticists and biomechanicists understand the dynamics of leg stability, the energetics of bipedal gaits, and the tradeoffs between various model parameters during development{{< cite "Ha" >}}. Others have used full-body inverse dynamic approaches for trajectory optimization and control, including [@Righetti2011; @Kuindersma2016; @Winkler2015; @Winkler2017; @Dai2014; @Koenemann2015a; @Doshi2019; @ZAPOLSKY2013; @Manchester2017].

Rigid body simulators and physics engines have been used extensively to model and control walking systems. Some examples of modern simulators in use include MuJoCo{{< cite "Todorov2012" >}}, Moby[@MobyWebsite; @Drumwright2008], Drake{{< cite "RussTedrakeandtheDrakeDevelopmentTeam2019" >}}, DART{{< cite "Lee2018a" >}}, SimBody{{< cite "Sherman2011" >}} (for primarily human biomechanics studies), and ODE{{< cite "Hsu2014" >}}, amongst a variety of others [@Gillespie1997; @Boeing2007; @Harris2011]. Physics engines must make tradeoffs between precision and speed across a number of physical phenomena important to the modeling of modern robotic systems including contact detection{{< cite "Reggiani" >}}, friction[@Baraff1994; @Stewart2000; @Drumwright2011], rigid kinematic constraints, error correction{{< cite "Baumgarte1972" >}}, etc. Ease of use and accessibility are also important considerations; commercial simulators such as ADAMS can often cost thousands of dollars per seat, while gaming engines like Unity{{< cite "UnityTechnologies2019" >}}, are freely available for personal use, with a large development community and a variety of tutorials, despite its focus on real-time rendering quality rather than numerical precision.

## Compliance and Mechanics 

Few of the simulators above natively support soft or compliant continuum elements; their speed is often made possible by using models with relatively low numbers of moving bodies typical found in stiff, engineered systems. Cassie, for example, has twenty degrees of freedom {{< cite "Gong2018b" >}} while Atlas has 28{{< cite "Kuindersma2016" >}}. Compared to simple mechanics models in a modern multiphysics package like Abaqus or COMSOL in which the elements can easily number in the thousands, these systems are optimized for branching, tree-like mechanisms such as traditional, six-axis robotic arms or legged humanoids, in order to take advantage of recursive algorithms[@Featherstone2000; @Featherstone1983]. Many integration schemes used in rigid body simulators also exhibit reduced performance in the presence of mixed stiffnesses{{< cite "Hairer1996" >}}. Thus, introducing even one multi-dimensional soft element creates representational challenges for rigid body simulators. Compliance in one or more joints has previously been factored into modeling[@Scarfogliero2009; @Pratt1998; @Takuma2008; @Yang2008] and control[@Albu-Schaffer2001; @Vanderborght2008; @Hashimoto2006], though FEA-based mechanics models have only seen regular use in fully soft systems[@Aguilar2016; @Miller2006; @Duriez2013; @Suzumori2007].
