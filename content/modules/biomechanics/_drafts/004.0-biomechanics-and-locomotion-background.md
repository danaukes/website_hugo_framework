# Biomechanics and Locomotion Background

## Background

A great review of locomotion through 2000 can be found in {{< cite "Dickinson2000" >}}

## Basic Concepts

Locomotion is based on timed energy exchange:

1. Chemical to Mechanical (Potential and Kinetic)
1. Mechanical energy storage and release in muscles & tendons via material elasticity
1. Exchanges between potential and kinetic energy as a function of body configuration and muscle coordination
    1. Timing-based
    1. Sensor-based feedback
1. Released on the world in the form of:
    * work done
    * heat generated
    * medium displaced
    * ...

Locomotion breaks symmetries

* Directional friction between feet and ground
* Differences between static and dynamic friction
* Differences in lift and drag between power and recovery stroke.
* Vortex and wake Generation in fluids
* Configuration-dependent energy storage and release within the body

## Types of Locomotion

### Dynamic Similarity

![Froude Number vs. Phase Difference between front and hind lengs in quadrupeds, from {{< cite "Alexander1983" >}}](../../figures-external/alexander1983/fig02.png){class="img-fluid"}


The "dynamic similarity hypothesis" by Alexander{{< cite "Alexander1976" >}}  identifies similarities across quadrupedal {{< cite "Alexander1983" >}} and later bipdeal{{< cite "Alexander1984" >}} and hexapedal animals{{< cite "Full1990" >}} whereby nondimensionalization of an animal's mechanics can be distilled down to the Froude number, or $\frac{u^2}{gl}$, where $u$ is speed, $g$ is gravity and $l$ is a length scaling factor such as hip height.  This number makes it possible to estimate an animal's dynamics (like a dinosaur's{{< cite "Alexander1976" >}}) without direct measurement.

### Other Scaling Relationships

![Leg Stiffness vs Mass, from {{< cite "Farley1993" >}}](../../figures-external/farley1993/fig03.png){class="img-fluid"}

Leg Stiffness also scales with body mass {{< cite "Farley1993" >}}.  


### Types of Locomotion

Types of locomotion

* Terrestrial
    * Walking
    * Running
    * Jumping
    * Undulation / Oscillation / Slithering
        * Peristaltic 
        * Transverse
    * ...  
* Swimming
    * Flapping Fins
    * Undulation / Oscillation / Slithering
        * Peristaltic 
        * Transverse
    * ...


### Gaits

Bipedal and quadrupeal animals exhibit a variety of gaits, the selection of which seems to minimize energy use or limb displacement {{< cite "Alexander1984" >}}.  

* Scansorial
* Cursorial
* Non-Cursorial

Quadrupedal running gaits include:

* amble
* trot
* pace
* canter
* transverse gallop
* rotary gallop
* bound
* pronk



## Terrestrial Models

![Inverted pendulum model vs. Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum Model](../../figures/modeling/ip-vs-slip.png){class="img-fluid"}

### Inverted Pendulum

<!--TODO: finish this up-->
This model has been developed for understanding walking gaits [@Cavagna1977; @Cavagna1964; @Alexander1975]

* Kinetic to potential to kinetic during the stance phase [@Cavagna1977; @Cavagna1976; @Mochon1980].  
* Similar to inverted pendulum, hence the name

Model Assumptions:

* the leg remains straight during stride, acting like a rigid link.
* body mass is collected in a single point mass
* leg mass is assumed to be negligible
* no slip on the ground
* the other leg is swinging and will take the leg at some angle.

Use Cases

* walking
* continuous contact with the ground (no ballistic phase)

<!--TODO: Add Dynamic Equations-->


### Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum

This model was originally developed for understanding running gaits [@Cavagna1977; @Cavagna1976; @Alexander1988; @Blickhan1989; @McMahon1990; @Farley1998]

Pogo Stick analogy

Assumptions

* leg flexes and stores energy like a spring
* damper is adjustable, assumed zero
* initial velocity is x

Use Cases

* Running
* Ballistic Phase

Discuss how it's been used, connection to Froude number.

Stiffness and Speed also come into play in  {{< cite "McMahon1990" >}}

* Dogs {{< cite "Cavagna1977" >}}
* Kangaroos {{< cite "Alexander1975" >}}
* Lizards: {{< cite "Farley1997" >}}
* Crabs: {{< cite "Blickhan1987" >}}
* Cockroaches: {{< cite "Full1991a" >}}
* Geckos:

* Crabs: {{< cite "Blickhan1987" >}}
* Crayfish [@Klarner1986; @Clarac1982; @Domenici1999]

Elastic Storage and Recovery in Legs {{< cite "Ting1994" >}} {{< cite "Schmitt2000a" >}}

Benefits cases where animal is accustomed to disturbances {{< cite "Kubow1999" >}}

Sprawled postures are better [@Domenici1999; @Jindrich1999]
