# Sketching 2D Kinematics in CAD

## Introduction

## Steps

1. Create a planar sketch
1. Turn off the background color in Solidworks by changing the background to plain white in the options at the top of the viewport window.  This will make exporting your sketches easier.
1. Translate each rigid link into a straight line.
1. Connect each line at a vertex.  Vertices function as a revolute joint in 2D sketches, and spherical joints in 3D sketches.
1. Define the lengths of each link.
