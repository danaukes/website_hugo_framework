# Introduction

This book envisions a time when robots eventually contribute to society in a meaningful way by solving problems that humans alone cannot. For this transformation to occur, the public needs more than just access to controls literature and theory. It needs access to systems whose cost and performance can be scaled to solve massively parallel problems such as picking crops, and access to tools that make designing complex dynamical systems for providing walking assistance to the elderly as easy as picking specifications from a menu. And finally it needs new capabilities for prototyping and interacting with robotic systems from an early age, both in the classroom and at home. By getting robots into the hands of people through a focused shift towards affordability, customization, and accessible fabrication, we have the potential to organically transform the nature of work *by the people who perform it.*

The goal of this book, therefore, is to enunciate that path forward from where we are now. The slow speed and high cost of developing a new robot often leads engineers to design conservatively and to specify general purpose performance requirements that can satisfy a wide range of user needs across a variety of applications. Generality comes at a cost, however; the need for precision *and* payload implies more rigid designs, stiffer, heavier components, and bigger actuators. All of these design decisions results in robots ill-suited for what they ideally do best: 

* working in dangerous environments where they might easily be damaged, 
* performing low-value, repetitive tasks that no one is willing to do, and
* quickly scaling in swarms and teams to solve challenges in parallel.

In order to break the spiraling cost of developing "generalist" robots, this book approaches the design process in a different way: selecting affordable material systems, focusing on the design of customizable, "specialist" platforms, and selecting accessible fabrication strategies that encourage rapid prototyping and iteration. As current approaches in robotic modeling and control generally assume rigid systems with thoughtfully-inserted compliance, this approach also requires new methods for *modeling and tuning lower-cost, compliant materials for use in high-performance dynamical systems*.

<!--#### Objectives:-->

This book thus introduces a holistic <!--vision--> workflow for designing, manufacturing, understanding, and tuining dynamical robotic systems that are both affordable and easily prototyped. The goal is to *make it possible for non-experts to design and prototype a robot in an hour.*

<!--This book is intended to be serve as a how-to manual, a survey of the field, an introduction to the theory, so that you understand what's already been done, succesful design strategies that work, and the theoretical underpinning to make you successful at building a foldable robot.  It has several purposes: first, to teach you how to design and build foldable robotic devices using the tools available in a maker space, and second, to teach you how to make and use design tools which can help you solve your own problems in this field.  Foldable robots are still new, and because of that, there are very few resources available outside of an extensive paper review.  I will attempt to put together the information required to conceptualize, design, create the manufacturing files for, and build a laminate device from scratch.  To accomplish this, the book will cover a variety of topics related to foldable robotics, including bio-inspired design principles, materials, manufacturing, design workflows, stiffness analysis, kinematics, dynamics,

# Introduction

This book is about fusing knowledge across a wide number of domains so that you can cobble together an understanding of a new and very exciting type of device being developed in the classroom and for research.  

Foldable devices have emerged from a variety of considerations, but one of the biggest is the deficiencies of traditional robots.  While there are a wide range of robots out there, traditional robots are usually stiff, heavy affairs with rigid links, low-backlash transmissions, high tolerances, and precise, high-power, rapid motion.  Foldable robots try to approach tasks from a different perspective.  At  scales such as the millimeter / centimeter scale, traditional mechanisms are neither feasible nor available.  Traditional systems composed from bearings, gears, motors, belts, drives, and pulleys, are simply too large to fit on small devices.  MEMS-based solutions require cleanroom facilities and produce geometries which are too small.  So to facilitate building precise robotic devices at the millimeter scale, a group of researchers have been working on creating devices and mechanisms using planar fabrication techniques which are compatible with many of the trends we see in rapid prototyping today.

Foldable robot design techniques are attractive because they can leverage the precision of digital fabrication techniques now commonly available in your average "maker space".  While the 3D printer has received most of the attention, it is often the laser cutter which is the most heavily used device in a maker space.  With nothing more than cardboard, plastic film, and adhesive, multi-material hinged mechanisms can be made with all the precision available from modern laser cutters.  These mechanisms form the backbone of foldable robots, and with the right setup, this planar fabrication mentality can extend to circuits and actuators too.

and programming.  It will introduce you to the trends in many of these fields and give you a working understanding of the rest.  Most importantly, it will give you the vocabulary used by the experts; in this age of ubiquitous computing, the most important thing is to know how to ask the right question.  Once you can do that, finding the right answer is easy.  This book will help you learn that vocabulary.

<!--There is a common problem in the field of robotics, which is that in order to create a more unique story and more-publishable paper, researchers think of and represent their robot as a completely unique permutation of challenges and solutions... in other words the first to solve a very specific problem, and the best and solving it.  Yes, there may have been a number of robots to come before, and yes, the terminology in their particular sub-field may already have been established and defined, but because of the unique set of constraints which has been somewhat-artificially established, the researcher gives him or herself permission to ignore prior methods or best practices and do their own thing.  This leads to a highly segmented design space, with little thought to how one given design addresses previous problems or solutions.  This is my attempt to help unify some of these problems in laminate robots.  To acknowledge the simliarities,  highlight the differences, and smooth out the design space a little bit, so that we can all approach this design problem with a common set of terms and, perhaps, thought processes.

## Goals

The goal of this book is to make it easier for novices and experts alike to get used to the idea that *they can make robots*. This isn't the easiest thing to discover, and its not easy, but it doesn't have to be expensive or slow. I want to show kids how to do it; maybe the kids can even show their parents.

## Organization of the Book

This book is split into several parts. The first part introduces the origins, motivations, and background of foldable, mechanisms, devices, and robots.  The second section discusses  workflows for designing a foldable robot, along with the innovations and manual interventions which may be required. Part III discusses several examples of this workflow in use, and Part IV discusses research opportunities which exist in the field.
