# Planning your Design

When planning your design, it is best to gather all the parts, tools and materials you will need.  I will organize this into a minimal, desired, and advanced setup.

## Tools Needed

### CAD

#### Kinematics

You will need CAD for several reasons if you want to visualize and interact with your designs. There are many free options around, but not as many which permit live dragging of partially constrained sketches. This is important if you want to play around with the kinematics in software, but perhaps without programming the kinematics in python. This is sometimes desirable over playing in paper alone, as paper models can bend and flex in ways that the final robot may not be able to. Thus, visualizing the rigid kinematics of the robot and being able to drag the mechanism around can alert you to singularities, non-ideal behavior you may see in softer models, etc, and permit you to quickly alter your design by changing a parameter or dimension to escape ....in a way which might be slow to realize test, and alter in a physical prototype.

In this book we use several different methods to understand the kinematics of rigid systems.

#### DXF editing

Autodesk^[http://autodesk.com] provides a number of CAD tools for free for academic use.  Dassault Systemes also has Draftsight^[https://www.3ds.com/products-services/draftsight-cad-software/], an AutoCAD-like clone for DXF and DWG file editing. It does not feature constrained sketch capabilities, but you can easily edit dxfs directly for input into manufacturing code. I recommend it for that step only.

Popupcad^[http://www.popupcad.org] is a software developed by me. It does not permit 3d visulalization of kinematics, but it has a rudimentary sketcher which permits dragging of 2d constrained sketches. I would not recommend it for complex kinematics with more than 10-20 constraints, as the current solver cannot handle solving them in real-time. popupCAD is very useful for calculating manufacturing files, however, so if you have a 2d sketch ready to be populated to a multi-layer design, consider using this tool.

### 3D Printer

Not everything can be easily made out of cardboard. I encourage you to take as many shortcuts as you can. One category of part which can or should be 3d printed if possible are all your mounts between off-the-shelf components and

### Cutting 

Laser cutter or vinyl cutter or waterjet

-   Clothing Iron
-   Hot glue gun
-   Heavy duty scissors or kitchen shears
-   Exacto knife, razor blade, scalpel
-   Tweezers
-   Large flat surface which can take some heat.
    -   Watch out for nice finishes on wood tables, plastic countertops.
    -   My best suggestion would be to cover your work surface in a
        piece of mdf

### Heat Sources

-   Pouch Laminator
    -   These inexpensive machines are typically used to laminate pouches. They may not have much temperature control and are limited in thickness, but they are low-cost.
-   Roll Laminator
    -   These laminators use 2 or more heated rollers which can be adjusted to a variety of thicknesses to permit you to laminate a wider range of thicknesses, usuallywith temperature control
    -   They get expensive but you can laminate any length you want.  Some provide board mounting options which means you can feed thick materials through
-   T-shirt Press
    -   You can handle a variety of thicknesses, control temperature, but are limited to a fixed maximum area

## Materials Needed

### Simple Makeup

There are lots of good reasons not to invest in a particular laminate design too early. These designs are complex and take longer to make. They can delaminate if you don't have your process down right, their thickness can influence the range of motion of your hinges

Cardboard or Posterboard

Blick Railroad Board, 6-ply

This posterboard is just at the lower-limit of usefulness

Reinforcing Material

I recommend attaching rigidizers to your laminate links once assembled. In my bird leg, for example, early prototypes used bamboo coffee stirrers to rigidize longer links which were deforming too much under load. Balsa is another great rigidizer, and is easy to work with. People with laser cutters love acrylic, but I find it both too dense and too brittle to be useful. Use plywood or balsa instead.

### Laminate Makeup

#### Link Material

* Cardboard
* Fiberglass
* Carbon Fiber

#### Joint Material

* Polyester -- available from mcmaster in a variety of thicknesses.  Recommend anywhere between .005" to .020" depending on durability and stiffness needs.
* Kapton -- Tears more easily than polyester but is less stiff.

#### Adhesive Material

You will need an adhesive to stick all the layers together. I recommend finding thermoset adhesive used in sign-making. Two optinos include MHA and the Activa Hot mount

#### Connectors

![Rivet](../figures/design/rivet.png)

I suggest buying a couple sets of plastic rivets, which can make multilayer or multi-loop kinematics much easier to design. Ususally the thinnest from Mcmaster are sufficient, but there are a variety of lengths available. Use the smallest diameter available(3mm)

Parts Needed
------------

* ProTrinket + programmer
* Adafruit Metromini
* Opencm
* Raspberry Pi

### Microcontroller

I recommend arduino-based microcontrollers just for the sheer number of examples you can find, the large community that surrounds these systems, and to future-proof your robot and make it possible to quickly and easily port to a larger or smaller microcontroller without changing much code

Adafruit Pro Trinket -- One of the lighter and more capable little microcontrollers; full serial communication requires a usb-serial adapter (available on Adafruit amongst others)\ Adafruit Metro Mini -- Just as good as the pro-trinket, a little heavier, but has usb-based downloading and debugging

Dynamixel OpenCM1.04 -- bashed on arduino, but to take advantage of some of the native libraries I suggest using the opencm ide, which is a hacked-apart version of an older arduino ide. This means there is no native string support or support for other arduino based boards, but you get many more dynamixel examples that work out of the box. Dynamixel provides a board definition file to use with the vanilla arduino ide, but the libraries they make available are not the same and not as usable (in my opinion).

Raspberry Pi -- The downside is that you have to learn a new operating system(raspian). The upside is you have a full-fledged computer. Fewer IO count, which is expandible with off-the-shelf i2c boards, but you need to make the decision: am I doing complex computations on board or off-board? Do I need more I/O pins or a higher-level programming language? Do I care about weight or processing power?

### Actuators or Servos

Adafruit RC Servo -- At roughly six dollars, this little servo can do
wonders on a budget. There is a metal-geared one, but if you look at the
specs, it is twice the torque, but also twice the weight. If your goal
is to remain small and light and low-cost, this is the place to start

Linear RC Servo -- If you want straight-line motion, consider getting it
directly from this line of rc servos.

Dynamixel xl320

Pololu Motor system

Pololu has a wide range of motors, motor drivers, and encoders which can all be used together to create a relatively low cost motion control system. These devices are great for prototyping and selecting just the right gear ratio for your project...the same motor often has 10-20 different gear ratio selections which all work with the same electronics and encoder -- but I would only recommend this option if you really need to customize. The motors pololu builds off of are not anything special. They are cheap, but not high performance. But they are a good starting point if you are trying to learn how to select and use motors, drive them, and read their position with finer-grain control than a servo. Just not for the faint of heart.

### Sensors

I won't get into the plethora of sensing options you have with your robot. These are up to you. Sparkfun and Adafruit have a variety of off-the-shelf components. A couple of highights include a i2c imu which can be used for data collection and experimentation, a current/voltage sensor you can use to verify your power usage, and a load cell you can mount to a flat plate to get the ground reaction forces of your robot.

#### Communication

Usb-serial device

Midi sound board -- this hardware device has a lot of sliders which you
can hack to send

Commands over serial or wifi to your microcontroller. This is sometimes
easier to controll and interact with than a terminal screen or GUI, and
is very flexible in how it can be defined. I have made a simple script
to communicate with the Korg NanoPad I using python+pygame+pyserial.
