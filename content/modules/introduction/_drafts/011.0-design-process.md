# The Design Process

## Getting Inspired

Step 1 involves researching a motion you would like to replicate with a mechanism. This process can be inspired by biology, can replicate a traditional robot, or can be composed directly by combining kinematic elements native to foldable devices.

Bio-inspired robots come in all shapes and sizes, and typically are a good starting point when the designer is trying to create a device which permits the robot to move about in the world. Animals are innate experts at niche locomotion, and the study of how their legs, arms, wings, and fins interact with the world can provide a basis for selecting a good set of parameters which define your design.

## Modular Approach

A particularly effective way to create designs is to reuse as much as possible from design to design. Some of the most commonly reused design elements are the connections you will need to make to off the shelf parts.  Select a small number of high-quality (or cheap) Off the shelf components which you plan to use over and over, and design around these components.  For example, I often use a particular low-cost RC servo motor^[https://www.adafruit.com/product/169] in the classroom, and have built a small library of parts which can be used to adapt this servo to the needs of foldable robots.  This includes a single-layer design which permits this actuator to be embedded in the corner of a robot, a 3d printed housing with aligned holes for use in a laminate sheet, and  a custom-printed servo horn which attaches to a flat sheet.

## Paper prototyping

The first step in the design process is to play.  Take paper, staples, tape, scissors, and fold up shapes in order to understand the types of mechanisms you can make.  

I highly suggest looking at parallel mechanisms.  These devices typically are more difficult to make using precision components, but are easy to fabricate out of paper.  These devices are often more stiff because there are more than one pathway through which forces and torques can be resisted by the device.  This is good for soft systems, where serial linkages consisting of lightweight material can suffer quickly from distal loads.

The major feature of a parallel mechanism is that kinematically it looks like a closed loop, with more than one pathway to the grounded link.  Thus, the definition of which is the output link can often be muddied, as there may be more than one "distal" link.  When designing these mechanisms, it is important to be clear which link you are designating as the distal (output)  link early in the process.  Typically, single-loop parallel mechanisms must have at least 4 joints and four links.  One of those links must be considered as "grounded" for the sake of analysis.  This leaves three moving parts.  Typically, the two proximal links adjacent to the grounded link cannot be considered the output link because they do not exhibit any complex motion as a funciton of the mechanism, only simple rotation.

The simplest planar parallel mechanism is the four-bar linkage.  This is a single-input, single-output system in which one motor may be used to move the output link about in space.  We will discuss the kinematics of this device more later, but it can be made a number of different ways.  

Another class of mechanisms you can design quickly and easily are spherical parallel mechanisms.  Spherical mechanisms can be made by having 4 or more lines meet at a point.  When one or more joints are actuated, this creates rotational motion at the output.  You may define which link is the output, but it is typically the
