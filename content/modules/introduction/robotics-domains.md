## Introduction

Robotics is multidisciplinary.  Foldable robotics draws from the following fields

* Mechanical Design - The process of determining the parameters and their values that should be used in creating a physical device.  
* Dynamics - The study of how forces create motion.
* Kinematics - The study of how geometric rules drive motion/force relationships, and how those rules can be applied to systems of linkages, gears, and other mechanisms.
* Optimization - The study of how to arrive at a set of parameters that achieves a stated goal.
* Mechanics - The study of how materials bend and flex under load (stress and strain).
* Material Science - The study of how to compose, improve, and engineer matter and materials.
* Controls - The study of how to add power to physical systems through actuation to achieve a certain performance goal.
* CAD - Computer Aided Design.  A wide range of tools used in the design process
* Biomechanics - The study of how anmimals move
* Computer Science: Programming, Machine Learning / AI, Planning & Decision-Making
* Mechatronics & Embedded Systems: Circuits, Hardware, Microcontrollers, Programming, Communication, and Debugging
