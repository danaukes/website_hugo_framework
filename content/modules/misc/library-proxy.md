title: Using the ASU Library Proxy
types: [tutorial,]

## Introduction

Accessing journal and conference papers off-campus can be a chore, made more difficult by having to use VPN's or navigate ASU Library's search tool.  But there's an easier way!

Drag this link into your bookmark toolbar and click whenever you want to sign in to a specific page through the library's proxy server.  It will reload the page you are on, often giving you access to the paper you are seeking.

<a href="javascript:location.href=location.href.replace(/^([^\/]+\/\/[^\/]+)/,'http://ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/login?url=$1');" target="_blank">ASU Library Off-Campus Sign-In</a>
